Theta1
    {ticks = 1556} corresponding to {theta1 = 0}
    increasing theta1 increases motor ticks (same direction)

Theta2
    {ticks = 2780} corresponding to {theta2 = 0}
    increasing theta2 increases motor ticks (same direction)

d3
    {ticks = 300} corresponds to d3 = 0.2 m
    ~0.0000412 m/tick [NEED BETTER MODELING]
    increasing ticks increases d3 length (same direction)
